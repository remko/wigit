* WiGit: A Git-based Wiki *
***************************

About
-----
WiGit is a simple Wiki written in PHP, using Git (http://git.or.cz/) as 
a backend for tracking changes. Besides Git, this wiki makes use of Textile
(http://textile.thresholdstate.com/) for marking up text. 


Features
--------
* Very simple and light
* Easily customizable using themes
* Extensive syntax for marking up text (using Textile)
* Full history tracking support
* Basic support for users/authors, by using the HTTP authentication headers 
  to extract the user.
* Support for pretty URLs (using URL rewriting)


Requirements
------------
* Webserver
* PHP4
* Git


Installation
------------
* Put the WiGit dir in some place where the webserver can find it
* Make sure there's a 'data' subdir, and that it is writable by the webserver
* Copy config.php.sample to config.php, and edit config.php to reflect your 
  local settings
* Surf to the wigit URL, and you should start by editing the front page

For URL rewriting, change the SCRIPT_URL to be the base URL prefix (as 
is shown in the config file), and add the necessary URL rewrite rules for
your webserver. E.g.,
* For Apache, add the following to .htaccess in your wigit install dir:
		<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
			RewriteEngine On
			RewriteBase /wigit/
			RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
			RewriteRule (.*) /wigit/index.php?r=$1 [L] 
		</IfModule>
* For lighttpd, add the following to your config file:
    url.rewrite-once (       
        "^/wigit/templates/(.*)" => "$0",
        "^/wigit(.*)" => "/wigit/index.php?r=$1",
      )
(where /wigit is replaced by your own base url)

For user support, configure your webserver to require authentication for
the wigit install dir. E.g.
* For Apache, add the following to .htaccess in your wigit install dir:
		AuthType Basic
		AuthName "My WiGit"
		AuthUserFile /path/to/passwords/file
		Require valid-user
* For lighttpd, add the following to your config file:
		auth.backend = "htdigest"
		auth.backend.htdigest.userfile = "/path/to/htdigest/file"
		auth.require = (
		      "/wigit" => (
							"method" => "digest",
							"realm" => "My WiGit",
							"require" => "valid-user",
						)
				)
